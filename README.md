# Mini-Blockchain
# from blockchain import Blockchain


This is an example of how a blockchain works using Python. I created these files via a tutorial on Codecademy.

This program allows you to create a blockchain with encodes it using cryptography and hashes the value. It allows yout to create a block object and blockchain object which is a collection of the block object. 

This program allows:
1. Create a blockchain
2. Add a block to the blockchain
3. Print the blocks in the blockchain
4. Validate chain to check if it has been tampered with therefore being invalid
5. Uses the "proof of work" which generates who is going to be authorized to add it to their chain
